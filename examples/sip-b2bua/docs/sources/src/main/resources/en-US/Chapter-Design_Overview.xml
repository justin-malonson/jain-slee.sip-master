	<para>The &THIS.EXAMPLE; Example is JAIN SLEE 1.1 Application which handles SIP sessions between a SIP UAC and UAS, through two different "legs", one per session party. In the originating session leg the application acts as UAS and processes the request as a UAC to the destination end, handling the signaling between end points back-to-back.Each side of a B2BUA operates as a standard SIP network element as specified in RFC 3261, the official SIP specification. The diagram below depicts the application behavior for all SIP messages exchanged by the session parties.</para>
