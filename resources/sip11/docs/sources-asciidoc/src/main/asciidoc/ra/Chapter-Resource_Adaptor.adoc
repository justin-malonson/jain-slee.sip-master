= Resource Adaptor Implementation

The RA implementation uses the {this-platform} JAIN SIP HA stack, an extension of the JAIN SIP Reference Implementation which provides high availability and fault tolerance.
The stack is the result of the work done by {this-platform} JAIN SLEE and SIP Servlets development teams, and source code is provided in all releases.
