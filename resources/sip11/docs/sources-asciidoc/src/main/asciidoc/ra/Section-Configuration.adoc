IMPORTANT: Spaces where introduced in `Property Name` column values, to correctly render the table.
Please remove them when using copy/paste.

IMPORTANT: JAIN SLEE 1.1 Specification requires values set for properties without a default value, which means the configuration for those properties are mandatory.
Otherwise the Resource Adaptor Entity creation will fail.
