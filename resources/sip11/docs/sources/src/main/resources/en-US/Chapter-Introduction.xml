	<title>Introduction to &THIS.PLATFORM; JAIN SLEE &THIS.RA; Resource Adaptor</title>

	<para>This resource adaptor provides a SIP API for JAIN SLEE applications, adapting the JAIN SIP 1.2 specification. JAIN SIP 1.2 is a Java specification for the Session Initiation Protocol, as defined by the protocol specs done by the IETF. Both transaction and dialog layers of the SIP protocol are available, to support all types of SIP applications through a single API. Lower level applications, such as SIP Proxies or Registrars typically use the transaction layer exclusively, while UAC, UAS and B2BUA higher level SIP applications rely on the dialog layer.</para>
	<para>Events represent SIP messages received by the SIP stack, or failure use cases such as timeouts. Unlike the base JAIN SIP 1.2 API, SIP Requests with different SIP methods are fired as different event types, the same happens for SIP Responses with status code. The events are fired on transaction or dialog activities.</para>
	<para>The Activities are the SIP Transactions and Dialogs, which applications in the SLEE may use to send SIP Requests and Responses, and to receive the events related with incoming messages.</para>
